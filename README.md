# MovingObject
Java code for a moving object on a given square table. 

As the first input, give the table size and the inital location of the object.
Eg, 4,4,2,2 ( create a 4*4 table and place the object on the 2,2 location)

In next inputs you can control the object move forward, backward, turn left, right and print the current location cordination.
Use below commands to communicate with the object. If the object fall out of the table, it will print [-1,-1]


0 = quit simulation and print results to stdout 
1 = move forward one step 
2 = move backwards one step 
3 = rotate clockwise 90 degrees (eg north to east) 
4 = rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees (eg west to south
